## Getting Started
Covid Daily is an app that allows people to track COVID-19 cases in an easy-to-use interface to increase awareness. Unfortunately, Play Store has rejected Covid Daily as the App Store Review Guidelines require that medical apps are published by medical institutions, so we've open sourced Covid Daily with the intent that people can use it.
